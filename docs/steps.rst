Defining Steps

Common regular expressions for capturing data
---------------------------------------------

**String**

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given I logged in as "alexey"

    .. code-block:: python

        @step(r'I logged in as "([^"]*)"')

**Number**

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Then the price should be $12.99

    .. code-block:: python

        @step(r'The price should be \$(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)')

**Path/URI/etc.**

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given I visit /user/alexey/profile

    .. code-block:: python

        @step(r'I visit ([^\s]+)')

Step loading
------------

Steps can and should be defined in separate modules to the main application
code. Eucalytptus searches for modules to load steps from inside the ``features``
directories.

Steps can be placed in separate files, for example,
``features/steps/browser.py`` and ``features/steps/data.py``, but all those
files must be importable, so this requires creating a (possibly empty)
``features/steps/__init__.py`` alongside.

Additional 3rd-party steps can be imported in from your ``__init__.py``.

An imported step can be overridden by using :meth:`unregister()` on the
function registered as a step. It can be then reused by defining a new step
with the same or different sentence.

Pytest Integration
----------------------

Fixtures
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Step arguments can be injected from step definition or be pytest fixtures. 
Arguments are resolved at runtime based on regusted fixture names.

Examples:

.. code-block:: python

    import pytest
    from pytest-eucalyptus import step

    @pytest.fixture
    def foo():
        return "foo"


    @step("I have injected foo")
    def injecting_given(self, foo):
        return "injected " + foo


    @step('I have "([^"]*)" and foo')
    def foo_is_foo(self, string_param, foo):
        assert foo == 'foo'


Writing good BDD steps
----------------------

It's very easy with BDD testing to accidentally reinvent Python testing
using a pseudo-language. Doing so removes much of the point of using BDD
testing in the first place, so here is some advice to help write better BDD
steps.

1.  **Avoid implementation details**

    If you find yourself specifying implementation details of your application
    that aren't important to your behaviors, abstract them into another
    step.

    Implementation:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        When I fill in username with "danni"
        And I fill in password with "secret"
        And I press "Log on"
        And I wait for AJAX to finish

    Behavioral:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        When I log on as "danni" with password "secret"

    You can use :meth:`Step.behave_as` to write a step that chains up several
    smaller steps.

    Implementation:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given the following flags are set:
            | flags                      |
            | user_registration_disabled |
            | user_export_disabled       |

    Behavioral:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given user registration is disabled
        And user export is disabled

    Remember you can generate related steps using a loop.

    .. code-block:: python

        for description, flag in ( ... ):
            @step(description + ' is enabled')
            def _enable_flag(self):

                set_flag(flag, enabled=True)

            @step(description + ' is disabled')
            def _disable_flag(self):

                set_flag(flag, enabled=False)

    Furthermore, steps that are needed by all features can be moved to a
    :func:`~eucalytptus.before.each_example` callback.

    If you want to write reusable steps, you can sometimes mix behavior
    and declaration.

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Then I should see results:
            | Business Name (primaryText) | Blurb (secondaryText) |
            | Pet Supplies.com            | An online store forâ€¦  |

2.  **Avoid conjunctions in steps**

    If you're writing a step that contains an `and` or other conjunction
    consider breaking your step into two.

    Bad:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        When I log out and log back in as danni

    Good:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        When I log out
        And I log in as danni

    You can pass state between steps using :attr:`world`.

3.  **Support natural language**

    It's easier to write tests if the language they support is natural,
    including things such as plurals.

    Unnatural:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given there are 1 users in the database

    Natural:

    .. code-block:: gherkin

        Given there is 1 user in the database

    This can be done with regular expressions.

    .. code-block:: python

        @step('There (?:is|are) (\d+) users? in the database')
